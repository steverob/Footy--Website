			<h1>Man United stick to Rooney story</h1>
			<img src="images/rooney.png" alt="Rooney" />
			<p>Manchester United have dismissed reports in the Sunday newspapers that Wayne Rooney was dropped for the 3-2 defeat against Blackburn for disciplinary reasons.<br />

Rooney was not even selected as a substitute for Saturday's shock defeat at Old Trafford, despite manager Sir Alex Ferguson being forced to name five untested youngsters on the bench. It was reported in the Mail on Sunday and the Sunday Mirror that Rooney, along with Darron Gibson and injured defender Jonny Evans, were involved in "a boozy night out" on Boxing Day and that was the reason the striker was absent from the squad.<br /><br />

However, Manchester United insist Rooney was omitted for fitness reasons and the club's website continued to report the statement Ferguson made about his team selection to ESPN prior to kick off. "Wayne hasn't trained well this week, he's missed a few days and we're hoping that he trains today, tomorrow and, by Wednesday, he should be okay. It's little strains here and there."<br /><br />

Rooney and Gibson are reported to have trained on Saturday morning before heading to Old Trafford to see their team-mates fail to assume top spot in the Premier League, as had been anticipated.</p>
