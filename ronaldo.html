			<h1>Ronaldo: La Liga is world's best</h1>
			<p>Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo believes La Liga is the best league in the world and has an advantage over the Premier League due to superior "personal and technical skills". <br /> <br /> <img src="images/ronaldo.jpg" align="top" /><br /> <br />

Ronaldo, speaking at an international sports conference in Dubai, stated his preference for the style on offer in Spain as he continues his third season in Madrid. The 26-year-old Portugal international previously spent six years at Manchester United, and ackowledged the impact his time at Old Trafford had on his development before making the switch to the Bernabeu in 2009.

"I follow the Portuguese championship, but I prefer the English Premier League, where I learnt the elementary basic rules of football, especially discipline. But the Spanish league is exceptional. It relies more on personal and technical skills. "I believe that La Liga is the best league worldwide, although I spent six years in the UK. Both championships are completely different to one another on technical levels," Ronaldo said. Ronaldo also used the conference to shrug off rumours he is looking to move away from Real Madrid next season, insisting he is happy to remain part of Jose Mourinho's squad into the foreseeable future. "I am a player and players can adapt to any league. I can play in any country. But I'm happy today with Real and will stay with them in the future. "Frankly, I haven't thought about the next step. I'm just enjoying the moment and continuing to enjoy my football at Real Madrid. For the moment, Spain presents the greatest pleasure for me," he said.<br /><br /><p></p></p>
